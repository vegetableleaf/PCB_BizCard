Title says it all. Includes an LED and an NFC chip that I plan on linking my Github page to. This is my second project for Hack Club's Highway program.

## <ins> **Schematic & PCB** </ins>
This time, I used EasyEDA to design the Schematics and PCB. KiCAD was giving me a bit of trouble as it was unable to detect the footprints that I downloaded. I probably missed some step that caused the error but EasyEDA works all the same.
