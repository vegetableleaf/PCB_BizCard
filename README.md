Title says it all. Includes an LED and an NFC chip that I plan on linking my Github page to. This is my second project for Hack Club's Highway program. It was a quick and fulfilling project that allowed me to express my artistic skills through the PCB design.

Here's the back if anyone was curious:

This time, I used EasyEDA to design the Schematics and PCB. KiCAD was giving me a bit of trouble as it was unable to detect the footprints that I downloaded. I probably missed some step that caused the error but EasyEDA works all the same.
